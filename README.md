# Hydrological_modelling [Work In Progress]
This is a project I am working for the course hydrological modelling. The goal of the course is to make a rainfall runoff model. This can be done in many ways however I decided to take a little bit of an unconvential route. Inspired by the people from https://neuralhydrology.github.io/ some Deep Learning will get the job done.
Please don't use any of these code for real projects other than playing around as this is mostly a hobby project, morphed in such way that I can hand it in for a course and get credits for it.
